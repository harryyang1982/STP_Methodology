Tanmay,Worst product from a reputed brand,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 28 December 2020,Verified Purchase,"------BEWARE!------
I was in need of a hand mixer, As i trust Philips brand i had purchased this hand blender. I bought it two months back, and have used it only two times. Yesterday while using it fumes started coming out of the machine and it stopped working abruptly. I had contacted amazon regarding this issue. They redirected me to the Philips brand and asked me to contact them. I was given an assurance by Philips they will contact me (Still waiting !).",100 people found this helpful
🙂,Nice product,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 6 November 2018,Verified Purchase,"Its a good product . But the beater could have been a bit smaller. I would suggest to opt for 200 watt philips beater.Cleaning the beaters are a bit annoying as no batter is to be left in the joint for a long life. If you are continuosly beating for more than 20 min, your hand might start to ache. But overall its a nice product.",190 people found this helpful

Tushar Rajvanshi,"By far the best product, but costly.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on July 17, 2021",Verified Purchase,"So first let me talk about my delivery experience. I ordered it for the first time and got the package in a very bad condition. The package didn’t have the amazon packaging and the whole product box was torn, looking at this I immediately returned it and got a replacement. Upon receiving the product for the second time, I got it in the orignal amazon packaging, but the amazon package was forcefully opened by someone (can’t say if it was the delivery person).
But the package inside was in a good condition when compare to last time.
So now talking about the product, this product is really good but when looking at its competitors, it sure is expensive. The product it self is really good and works as advertised. So I don’t think there is any issue with the product and I really would suggest you to go for it.
-2 stars for the packaging issue.",3 people found this helpful

Used only for cakes and brownies so far. Not tried the kneading function yet. Saves a lot of manual effort and the cakes turn out a lot fluffier.

I tried using it with the broken attachment and now all the joints have come apart. “Such a faulty design from Phillips !” I’m very disappointed with the quality .
Moreover on reaching out to their customer service I realised that the blades are not covered under the warranty scheme. It costs 880/- to replace the blades which is almost half the cost of the whole unit. The price seems completely unreasonable for 2 metals blades.
It’s almost like they are making a sun standard product so that you keep purchasing new blades from them.",3 people found this helpful

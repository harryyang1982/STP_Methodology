SAM,"It's absolutely not up to mark, don't buy.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 11 May 2019,Verified Purchase,"I have been using this machine for 3 wks and have found many fallacies to recommend not to buy it at all.
1. It has a name called BOSCH which is thought to be a class blindly, under this name they have created a poorly engineered craft and fooled their customers.
2.The lids of most jars has a poor design and loose fit that spills substance almost every time it is grinded.Specially liquids at a higher speed...this puts extra burden to clean kitchen desks.

3. The caps provided for ad-ons during processing just have a friction grip rather than a locking grip, so one has to hold it tight to be get a leak proof grinding and mixing.
4.Sounds well above the normal mixing decibels specially at 1000 watts, we can't keep it working for more than 1 minutes for one go.
5. Cost is higher c/f other equivalents.
6.Latch lock of the lids make washing a cumbersome job.It should have been a twist and lock system.
7.Lids have prone-to-break plastic that too aren't available separately.

Good things are
1.Sleek and compact design and nice looking.
2. Option for higher speed and rapid processing.
3.Nice juicing jar that adds taste to juices buy aerating them..

I want to return it back to BOSCH for free to make mine one an experimental piece to better their engineer capabilities wherein people are believing blindly. Review add up after 1.5 years---- I have registered a complain of geting main shaft's plastic breakage repair 1 and half months back but all in vain. No solution have been provided by the company , they just promise for 2 yr warantee but they are not dedicateed for the same, I will say this company don't have anything to do with customer care...Today on 25 April 21, I am still struggling to complain again for repair.This money if I would have lost in theft, I just have had repentance once only,but everyday as I see this machine in my kitchen I literally have started having psychological issues like anger, irritation and frustation.","1,214 people found this helpful"
Prasad Nayak,Seems like a good product going by the brand name but not worth it,2.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 5 March 2019,Verified Purchase,"Look wise a good product going by it's brand name. Powerful motor and looks sturdy built. Received the spatula and blunt pounding blade too...though not shown in pictures I uploaded. Height is 48 to 49 cms along with biggest jar when measured.
Although the item received is as described by the seller but I received the Mixer Jar with a broken clip. Must have been damaged during shipping......other wise the mixer is working fine. Planning to stick with a fevikwik instead of going for a whole replacement of the product. Had a previous bad experience of returning goods online. What I received in return was more damaged one. So don't want to take chances this time also. It will be time consuming too considering the pick up and to be delivered again. Rest of the review will update on product use.
Cons after Product use (6 months).
The blades are too tight and I am not able to change it. Cant loosen with the spatula provided. After few months of use the Jar's rubber has melted and worn out (pics attached). Won't recommend this mixer grinder don't go by the brand. I guess the regular brands available in market are good enough than this brand entering into kitchen appliances.
After 1 year of use.
The replaced rubber by Bosch has again melted. Sick of this",638 people found this helpful
unknown,Good with flaws,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 1 May 2019,Verified Purchase,"It's been only few days since purchase...the machine is powerful...a bit noisy....the jar for juices and smoothies I don't understand the concept because to get it moving you have to add water..e.g. Orange sweet lime etc..one has to cut them to small pieces or else they won't break down and you will end up drinking hot juice or smoothie as it takes time for large pieces to grind...also getting slight taste of oil residue in drinks ..personal opinion it's a useless feature ...use the jar without the mesh then its of use...good for grinding dry masala..as of now only made coriander powder so cannot comment about cinnamon,black cardamom etc..good for chutneys too.

Compared to other machines previously owned this one is better.

Cannot comment on service but sales representative are themselves not aware of the product they selling as I had purchased another Bosch product so had some queries regarding it which they themselves said that ""they don't have a clue,only passing on information they been asked to say""...hence returned it.",321 people found this helpful
Rohit Singh,Reviewing after 9 months 😊✌️,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 25 May 2021,Verified Purchase,"I am reviewing this product after thoroughly using it for 9 months. My review will be short, precise and divided into 3 sections, namely : pros, cons & satisfaction levels.

My mother and wife take care of the kitchen at our home. They were in dire need of a heavy-duty mixer grinder for quite sometime. In the past 25 years, we have used Havells (3 models), Philips (2 models), Braun (1 model) & Kitchen-Aid (1 model) ; and barring Kitchen-Aid, Braun is the only one still in use. Well somewhat 😊
So, you can be rest assured that my family really puts in the weight onto the ""Heavy-duty"" & sometimes unjustly so. Keeping that in mind, we bought the Bosch Pro 1000w this time around, with the expectation that it should last the way it says it does.

Pros :

(1) Well Built
(2) Solid plastic quality
(3) Neat & Clean engineering on the inside : what i mean is that wires are neatly tied, are of apt length and thickness. The motor is also quality-built with thick copper wires, and thick enamel coating on the stator/rotor windings. I can't explain a lot here, but since i am an electrical engineer, i hope you take my word for it.
(4) It has a separate pounder blade which Bosch said would pound masalas (gol mirch, saunf, rice (for dosa), sambhar, turmeric sticks, etc) to dust.

And for 8 months straight the machine did the job well. My mother went on to pound sugar too. I cautioned her not to. But she did it anyways. Surprisingly the machine kept on going. Then one fine day, she pounded jaggery dollops into powder as well. And the machine gave up. I have attached the pic of the white plastic groove that became free due to this. Due to Covid-19 lockdown in my district, Bosch took 22 days to replace that white plastic groove.

Cons:

(1) A ₹30/- groove should be available with the local service guy. It should not be imported from Mumbai. That's just poor logistics and poorer decision-making skills. Havells product quality is way poorer than Bosch but their service and spare-part availability is exemplary 1-7 days max & your problem is resolved. Philips is the most pathetic at 60 days minimum for anything.
(2) ""Heavy Duty"" was not ""Heavy-duty"" enough.

Customer Satisfaction :

Bosch. You guys are good. I will give you that. But you have never met anybody like an Indian Customer. Our households will put your claims to test, and they don't see things from an engineering point-of-view. They test it to the point-of-failure. Next time you depict an ad saying ""my pounder blade can pound sticks and gol mirch and what not"", make sure it can pound stones. If you argue, Indians won't fight much. They will simply dump your brand.",157 people found this helpful
ZenGirl,"Heavy duty mixer grinder, delivers what it promises",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 20 July 2020,Verified Purchase,"Bosch TrueMixx Pro Mixer Grinder 1000 Watt-MGM8842MIN, Black

Review:
I usually do not write reviews, but I felt I had to write this one, because when I was researching which mixer to buy I found really bad reviews that do not do justice to the product. I went with the trust on Bosch brand name and am extremely satisfied with the product. I have been using it daily, sometimes multiple times in a day for past month during lockdown period. I hope this will help others.

Mixer includes +capacity -

1 Mixer body
1 Plastic blender jar 1500ml + fruit filter,
1 Wet grinding jar 1500 ml
1 Dry grinding jar 1000 ml
1 Chutney grinding jar 400 ml
1 extra Pounding Blade
1 Spatula

Build and overall appearance

1. The mixer-grinder 1000 watt motor is extremely powerful.
I have used it to grind both dry & wet ingredients such as
garam masala, idli/dosa mix, Chana dal paste, Poppy seeds paste,
coconut chutney, dry rice and urad dal powder, ginger garlic paste, ice, etc.
I regularly blend and make milk shakes, lassis etc and have found it to very fast and convenient.
2. Does the job fast within few seconds/minutes depending on the amount and type of ingredients you are working with.
3. Body is good looking, sturdy, well balanced and easy to wipe clean.
4. The vacuum feet are quite secure and give a true hands free experience.
5. Overload protector for added safety helps if you overload the mixer by mistake.
6. The jars also are easy to use and quite well-built

Jars & Blades

1. The jars are metal with removable stainless steel blades.
2. Chutney jar blade is fixed.
3. An extra blade is provided for stone pounding affect.
4. A spatula cum blade changer is provided.
5. The Jar lids are made of transparent plastic.
6. Each lid has a small top cap which can be removed to add liquids/materials while grinding/blending.
7. Each lid has rubber gaskets. This gives a completely leak proof experience while grinding/blending. These gaskets are very easy to remove and attach.
8. All Jars have 4 fibre clasps to close the jars.
9. In the blender jar a juicer attachment has been provided – this is the only thing I have not used, hence I cannot review the performance of this attachment.
10. Blender can be used without the juicer sieve, and works fine.
11. In wet blender a flow-breaker is provided

Sound

Sound is high, but that is to be expected in a powerful 1000 watt machine.

Do’s & Don’t

I feel if we follow certain guidelines we can best out of the product

1. Do not overload
2. Do not use for more than a minute without giving a little rest.
3. When turning the speed knobs – don’t turn all at once from 0 to max. You will see that it works better if you turn knobs slowly, staying at each speed for a few seconds. Actually for most things low to medium speed is enough. The machine is really powerful.
4. When grinding large amount of ingredients the jar can heat up ( not the machine) so give a little rest in between.
5. For wet grinding – use cold water to grind – that way the jar will never heat up.
6. DO NOT grind hot ingredients. Many people have complained about the rubber gaskets melting – that can only have happened if hot food are being blended or ground. Bring food to room temp and then grind.
7. Wash the jar, gasket, jars immediately using a sponge and liquid detergent so that the shine of the jar remains intact.
8. Always remove and wash the gasket to avoid unhygienic conditions as food can get under the gaskets.
9. In the wet blender remove the flow breaker by sliding it off and wash it separately as food particles can get stuck behind it.
10. To remove fine particles when dry grinding don’t use a spoon to avoid scratches to the jar. You can use your hand and a brush ( used for this purpose only).
11. This is an expensive piece of equipment – In my house only I & my husband use it. We do not allow children or household help/cooks to use it. This way the machine will not be misused.
12. If you mixer does not work – please check the overload protector button on the underside of the machine. Remove some of the ingredients and try again.
13. Take care while handling jar lids and lid tops – Although they appear quite well made, I cannot say if they will break when dropped.

Pros

1. The machine is very powerful and delivers what it promises
2. It is easy to use and gives truly hands free experience
3. Easy to clean
4. Grinds and blends everything
5. Leak-proof lids.
6. Takes very little time to grind
7. The motor does not heat up even easily
8. The overload protector works perfectly

Cons

1. Guarantee & Manual - The Manual has to be downloaded from the Amazon website
The Amazon payment is the guarantee. There is no separate guarantee card provided. I had to call Amazon to understand the situation regarding the guarantee card.
2. Delivery - The mixer-grinder came in a box but there was no special Styrofoam padding. This was a big minus for me.
3. A couple of extra lid clasps should be provided – one of my lid clasps was loose, it is working fine at the moment, but as a backup company should provide these.
4. As the jars are pretty large, for smaller amount of products it is a little difficult. I wish the smallest chutney jar was usable for both dry & wet grinding rather than only wet.
5. The jars do have screws heads on the inner side – but this is not a big deal – and can be cleaned quite easily.",179 people found this helpful

* No black powder is coming from the gaskets
* Broad bottoms of the jars_ can take all the ground material easily
* Jars are big_ and make is very good
* There is a drainage type cut in the main body so that food leakage can be easily cleaned
* Grinding is real fine

SUMIT KUMAR SHARMA,Perfect example of Great Cry Little Wool,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 25 August 2019,Verified Purchase,"This mixer doesn't justify it's price. I was very excited after ordering this but when I received I was surprised to see the quality, it was not up to the mark. In fact I doubt whether it's a genuine Bosch product or not.
Quality of plastic and steel in jars are sub standard. One can get such quality in less than half of the price.
As it was mentioned on website that it's a returnable product so, while raising a request to return due to poor quality application took me for customer care assistance and there they denied to return giving the excuse they can only do it in case of technical issue. Though this policy they must have return somewhere inside the terms and conditions so that they can make a fool of customers just like nearby cheap shopkeepers do sometimes.
All in all in my opinion it's not the worth spending more than six and a half thousand rupees. Also, Amazon is loosing it's credibility as well along with BOSCH my brother bought Bosch washing machine and it has a manufacturing defect of front loading door gets jammed and Amazon denied it's replacement at first place after lot of struggling of 25 days he got it replaced and it has also the similar defect and ultimately after lit of hustle got the refund. So my person opinion to everyone please either don't buy BOSCH products or if want go buy then buy it from local market and specifically do not buy it from Amazon.",51 people found this helpful

Sasikumar Rajagopal,Doesn’t feel Bosch! Absolute Disappointment!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on October 15, 2020",Verified Purchase,"In spite of all the negative reviews I read, went ahead and bought this product. I believed on Bosch and thought they will not risk their brand value. But I was completely wrong!

Got this mixie delivered today and let me summarize my first impression here.

Unboxing - the packaging was so so poor. All the units were just wrapped in few plastic & papers, there was no padding to keep them intact. No wonder if they get scratches or broken during transit.

Build quality - the stainless steel and plastic feels cheap. Need to compare the weight of each jars against other brands. The jar are so thin and lite. Poor finishing on almost all units. In the videos, I see the pounding blade has gun metal finish, but it is all silver i got.

In other reviews people have mentioned the rubber gasket is peeling. I guess mine will be doing the same in coming days after couple of washes.

Operating noise - of course with 1000 watts motor, noise level will be high compared to other brands’ 500/750 watts motor. So no comments here.

This is just my first impression, and my recommendation is DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT, NOT WORTH THE HIGH PRICE TAG IT CARRIES. Doesn’t feel Bosch!",26 people found this helpful

Beena Shah,Partly disappointed,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on August 1, 2019",Verified Purchase,"This is an honest review after using it for 6 months. It definitely looks great and is made up of high  quality material. The machine /motor may be powerful but there are lots of minor issues with the design which do not give you a very smooth operating experience. I bought it as the brand is highly rated, and presumed that it would be a perfect design/piece with German technology. But I am quite disappointed. First of all, the jars fit on the mixer so tightly that it is difficult to take them off the machine. One has to give a very powerful jerky push with both the hands  to take them off. Secondly the small  circular center piece of the jar cover doesn't fit very well, is loose and falls off whenever the cover is being  washed.  Thirdly the gaskets of the jar covers are thick and made out of very crude rubber material. For such an expensive mixer - I expected silicon gaskets. These gaskets have a strange smell as well.

Dee,Fantastic grinding but painful to clean,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on September 30, 2020",Verified Purchase,"It's a beast at grinding, everything comes out fine be it a paste or a powder and it's so powerful that it does the job in a fraction of the time that my old one used to take without the overheat protection entering the picture. Been using it pretty regularly for more than a month and it has not shut down due to overheating even once whereas the old one had to be cooled down multiple times for the smallest jobs. Good at masala powders, chutneys or idli batter. BUT, the design team spent so much effort to ensure it looks good, well , looks like they never tried to clean it at all. If they had, they would have gone back to the drawing board and started over. The lids have so many crevices or projections that food always gets stuck. The gasket has too many grooves and there is a small ledge created by the gasket on the inside which holds the food and prevents it from sliding back down. The screws are another painful feature, they have used screws with deep star shaped cavities, pretty much have to pick the food out using a toothpick. Most of them are not flush against the walls of the jar, so another cleaning hassle. The jar lids have flow breakers that are really sharp and the edges on the cap are not filed down, some of the sharp edges are sharp enough to tear into the sponge I use to clean and have to be careful not to cut yourself. In short, it's a nightmare to clean but since there are not too many options at this power, had to compromise. Looks great, works great but HATE to clean! The blades are also tightened too much in the box, pretty much have to dismantle the whole shaft and use tools to remove the blades.",14 people found this helpful

The product doesn't look & feel premium but it does the job thanks to its 1000w motor I haven't used it that much cuz it's only been a day since I got this
One point to note is the plastic lockers(black plastic swiveling locks on the lids of the jars) or whatever they call em don't seem to be that durable very cheap plastic is used it's also thin and not so strong. The jars are well built the metal is sturdy and so are all the plastic lids no problem there , the blender is perfectly designed it has got those vaccum feet wc I like and the colour is pretty good but like I said it ain't that premium (for the money paid) it's all plastic even the middle part(which I thought will be a piece of metal but nope ┐( ∵ )┌ it's just metallic finish it's just painted plastic) where the knob is and the knob is made of plastic too
Out of the 4 jars one needs a lot of care the one meant for juicing stuff with a mesh thing inside I wonder how it survived even this long anyway I'll be updating my review soon hope this helps

Venkatasubramanian,Lousy plastics and poor design &workmanship of product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on November 12, 2020",Verified Purchase,"Despite an expensive product the workmanship of the product is lousy. A blackspot on Bosch brand for sure..
The plastic parts have flashes of the gates and runners are left out sharp on the plastics that easily cut the fingers of the person who scrapes the dishes and even while washing the jars.
The screw heads that secure the steel jar to its base were probably run down by a damaged tool or nutrunner, that left the dome headed screw slots damaged leaving sharp projection of screw material on top of the screw that I could not even manage to file off. I just asked everyone at home to remember it while washing and cleaning and be careful.. very very unsafe product and lousy Predespatch inspection of the product. I also see the design of the screw heads with slots projecting into the jar side can keep the jars from getting a good wash of internal side of the jar, harbour bacteria and mold. Not a healthy design..Bosch is destroying the brand name with this product design.
I definitely regret buying this low workmanship product.. I chose this over sujata grinder . A very bad decision. I hope the MD of Bosch appliances read this and improve quality of plastics and jars..and make it safe..not going to give even 1 star.",9 people found this helpful

3. Quality - does the work with perfection. Be it grating, grinding, chutney or juice making - everything is done so perfectly
4. Safety - Unique lock mechanism is a savior

7. Spill Management - Nice drainage system for accidental spill management saving interior parts

Cons:

We then again called the helpline no. in Chennai. The call centre staff began to play games like they can't hear, pls talk only in English while we could hear giggling of their mates in the background. Such harassment to a 75 yr old senior citizen who brought this a Diwali gift for herself.

Bottom Line : A half hearted attempt by Bosch, Resulting in a poorly designed and substandard product. Hope Bosch is Listening",10 people found this helpful

This product disappointed me when it comes to heating up , tried making dosa batter , just 10 seconds is all it took , 2 pulses for 10 secs , it got too hot that I could not even take the dosa batter out coz of the pipping hotness , even my mosambi juice came out to be super hot , I had to drink hot juice .
I can’t believe people are getting paid to write fake stuff on Amazon . This must stop .
Now I regret throwing out my old 500 watts mixer grinder . That was much better quality . I blindly believed the reviews .
Every time I use it I get a cheap plastic smell , from the jars .",5 people found this helpful
000 AAA 000,Not recommended,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on December 7, 2020",Verified Purchase,"Noise is very high. Not able to grind idli and dosa batter even with 1000 watts power. It's worse than 750 watts Sumeet mixer which I had been using since 2005. Won't recommend anyone for this. It's a review after using the product for more than one month. You can get a better product of much less price and better performance. You can see in the photo that it's not able to mix idli batter and got tripped twice.

It's a bad decision. Don't go with it only by brand. I got fooled by the brand by thinking that it may be a good product and a foreign home appliances brand.

Sandeep Jain,Paid Rs 674 more while buying this product in Prime deal offer on 27.07.2021 & 28.07.2021,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on July 28, 2021",Verified Purchase,"I ordered this product during the prime deal on 27.07.2021 & received on 28.07.2021. I paid Rs 6399.

I contacted Amazon call center and asking them what's the point to buy during prime deal and the reply was that its the policy and accordingly price has been charged.

So basically, i paid Rs 674 more in prime deal for which i was waiting in order to save some more.

If Amazon management may put some consideration towards this and to justify me how its possible to have more better offers in routine days and not in prime deal offer which was being published since long.",3 people found this helpful

The blades have a plastic fix on the top (most brands with steel blades have this as a smooth steel or copper part) that has poor finishing and lot of sharp crevices holding it in place, that will hold up dirt and will be very difficult to clean everytime.

Anirudh Chowdary ,Does the Job in seconds!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on October 30, 2020",Verified Purchase,"Hello guys, 😎 I don’t use the product but definitely want to share the insights shared by my mom.
Firstly, we use this for domestic purpose. Even though the ‘Noise level’ is bit high when compared with mixers used earlier, this Bosh 1000 watt machine sounds high; But I think 💭 heavy motors make noise when compared with low wattage machines.
Except that, the Bosh machine does the work in fraction of timeframe. The, clips/locks seems to be handled with care. Rest all the product is worth for the amount we give to Bosh.

Bejoy,Good quality Powerful Mixer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on October 3, 2019",Verified Purchase,"Good Quality product from Bosch India. Its specially good if you like making south Indian Food. Some features are specific to this. 1000W is a very powerful motor. so you need to be careful especially if you want a coarse grind. The mixer can easily make a paste in no time. Sometime just pulsing 2-3 times will get the job done.

Suggestion is to get used to the speed if you are coming from 500-750W mixers to this model. Once you understand the speed you will get great results

Saurabh Chakrabarti,"Powerful, efficient and quick",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on March 29, 2022",Verified Purchase,"We have been using this mixer / grinder since last 10 days and below are our observations so far -

Pros:
1. The main unit / motor unit build quality is excellent and look wise awesome, its an enhancement to our kitchen
2. The vacuum lock features ensures the main unit does not move while in operations - good attention to detail
3. Undoubtedly you will feel the 1000 watt power, grinding or pounding is quick and flawless - be it making batter for idly / dosa or preparing garam masala powder or daily use cumin / coriander powder - it works flawlessly
4. I feel the price is reasonable too, we have limited option available for 1000 watt range and Hamilton Beach is way too pricy option
5. The stone pounding blade is another good accessory which comes in this model - you can create the effect of traditional stone pounded masala which is not fully powder like. Excellent for dry chutney making.
6. Active flow breaker attachment in the wet grinding jar is a great feature which comes handy while working on sticky batter which at times leaves vacuum at the bottom - the tool is easily removable and attachable according to your need.
7. The chutney jar (smallest one) is able to paste even very small quantity - Bengali families are fond of ""posto bata"" / poppy seed paste / Khus Khus and usually pasting small quantity of khuskhus is a real pain - this machine even handles such tricky task qith ease - we were impressed

Cons:
1. The plastic lid quality could have been better for a premium model like this
2. Pounding blade comes without any coating and usual stainless steel made while the picture in amazon shows black coating on it - there were no mention of it about coating but picture should have been realistic

Overall impression - I could not find any better option at this price range and this product meets most of my expectations except few I mentioned above - but I think these can be ignored as it scores 5 out of 5 in most areas. It was a great decision to buy this product and I definitely recommend this product.",

Amazon replaced the product after a few enquiries via their chat support. So, the entire replacement experience was really good.
Anyway, coming to the product :
PROS :
1. It is super fast because the 1000W output motor. although the noise level is high, but you just have to use it for a few seconds to get desired results. For e.g. to grind chutney, operate it only for 10 seconds and it is ready.
2. The jars and the blades seem tough and strong. I think this is good mixer for heavy duty performance.
3. Going by the prompt response of the support, I should say the support service is good.
CONS :
1. Noise level a bit high but tolerable.
2. The jar's lids have four locks that doesn't look too strong. I am not sure if it will withstand for a long time.",One person found this helpful

Amazon Customer,"Good powerful motor, but it noisy",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on December 16, 2021",Verified Purchase,"The motor is powerful, that is the big plus.
But, I guess because of this the machine is extremely noisy.
The cap of each jar has a fundamental problem with its design. The grinded stuff gets stuck, on the surafce of the cap because the cap is not plain, it has a curved design & all grinded masala gets stuck on the glass surface of the cap and it is difficult to take them out. Which results in lot of wastage. Also the chutney jar is quite big in size so for a family of two, small chutney quantity is difficult to grind.
Company should redesign the cap of each jar. Make it plain like other mixie brand.
You can still deal with a noisy machine, but masalas and chutneys getting stuck in the surface of the cap is irritating.",One person found this helpful
Tarang,Awesome product from Bosch at this price range!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on September 26, 2020",Verified Purchase,"Awesome kitchen machine by Bosch. After a lot of searching and various mixed reviews of different brands we purchased this model and its really working great to the expectations.
Now using around 2 months and its going great with its performance. lock features is really useful and very few models in the market offer this. Noise level is also ok for 1000 watts of grinder. Ours previous mixer of Bajaj Rex 500 watt was horrible noisy than this. Wet grinding jar is really awesome for idly batter and does a quick job. Dry grinding jar with pounding blade also works well for dry spices and so the chutney jar and juicer works well to do its job. Design of the motor is also good and compact to occupy smaller area. Only the con is design of the jar lids, look wise very good but troublesome to clean as wet materials like batter or chutney traps in its design groves and becomes uneasy to collect all without using water. Bosch can work on it to improve.

Issue is with Amazon packaging, delivered only with thin transparent wrapping that was also torned. I was expecting a Amazon box packing as it has delicate parts. But thank God that all were safe and in good condition.

It does its job, so you will be satisfied. It can take good amount of load. But the jars get really hot, which i assume is with any grinder. The batter grinder also does a good job in a short time. There is a masala pounder which also does great for dry grinding. I did sambar masala at home during this pandemic, it worked amazingly.

Things I will keep an eye: The lid cover.. the design is lock with flaps, and the quality is really poor or at least looks very poor. If one of the flap breaks you cannot use it.

To say about the mixer itself. I checked in person some recent products similar to this one but I bet none can match this build quality and materials used. lot of attention to detail and elegance has come out well. despite 1000w motor, noise is low even at load. Innovative pounding blade and Dosa flour Jar attachment is huge winner for going to this model. Well done guys who designed it...
